# sonicadvanc3hacks
CS3274 final project! Some binary modifications for the SA3 ROM.

## What we did
We implemented 3 "hacks," though it really is only 2 viable cheats.

### Adding our names to the credits
Sanity check! If you make it to the end of the game and watch the credits screen, you'll see Allison and Rebecca's names under the "HACKER" title.

### Maximum rings
Whenever you pick up a ring, you'll actually pick up 255! This gives near-invincibility because if you take damage and drop all of your rings, you drop so many that you are almost guaranteed to pick up at least one ring, which actually gives you 255 again. Never lose a life ever again! :D

### Unlock all zones
Once you beat the Zone 1 (Route 99) boss, Dr. Eggman's hammer, you'll have all the zones unlocked in the Sonic Factory! Skip ahead all you want :)

## How to run
We ran our modified binary in [mGBA](https://mgba.io/). Just install mGBA and go to `File` > `Load ROM` > and load `hacked_SA3-3.gba`
